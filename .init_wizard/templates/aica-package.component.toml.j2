## by default, we will install any pip packages in `${package_source}/requirements.txt`
## but you can customize the name of the requirements file, e.g.
# [build.packages.{{ package_name.replace('_', '-') }}.dependencies.pip]
# file = "custom_requirements.txt"

## otherwise you can specify the pip packages directly
# [build.packages.{{ package_name.replace('_', '-') }}.dependencies.pip.packages]
# numpy = "1.0.0"
